            A Progressive Web Application for artists seeking to connect and
            collaborate. Artists can link up, chat, and enter a video conference
            room to reinvigorate a working practice and have access to community
            during a prolonged time of isolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Node, Express, React, Redux, Postgres/Sequelize as well as
            Socket.io, we created a Progressive Web App with built-in video and
            chat features. We relied on Node.jsâ€™s WebRTC API and sockets to
            build a persistent connection between two users. For our front-end,
            we used Redux to manage state across many React components,
            Bootstrap for styling, and Digital Ocean to manage media storage. We
            learned the challenges of managing multi-form data, the various
            approaches to implement live video streaming and chat capabilities,
            and how to connect users in real-time.
