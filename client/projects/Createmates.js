          A Progressive Web Application for artists seeking to connect and
          collaborate. Artists can link up, chat, and enter a video conference
          room to reinvigorate a working practice and have access to community
          during a prolonged time of isolation.

          Using Node, Express, React, Redux, Postgres/Sequelize as well as
          Socket.io, we created a Progressive Web App with built-in video and
          chat features. We relied on Node.jsâ€™s WebRTC API and sockets to build
          a persistent connection between two users. For our front-end, we used
          Redux to manage state across many React components, Bootstrap for
          styling, and Digital Ocean to manage media storage. We learned the
          challenges of managing multi-form data, the various approaches to
          implement live video streaming and chat capabilities, and how to
          connect users in real-time.
