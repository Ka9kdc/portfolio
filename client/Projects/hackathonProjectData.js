As columns clear and tiles become visable, empty columns will disappear from the game board. This allows for continuing game play by elimiting empty tiles that can not be traded. Another feature I implented was a randomize button. Clicking the button with randomly reassign the visable tiles to the bottom rows allowing for more tiles to fall down on to the game board.',
