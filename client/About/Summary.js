          I am a pilot and amateur radio operator who after taking on the
          challenge of updating her radio clubs website, has fallen in love with
          web development. Now I am a full stack developer specializing in
          Javascript who enjoys learning new technologies.

          My last full time job was as a Copy and Print supervisor at office
          depot. Most new Office Depot employees when you first mention the copy
          center, they think 'oh how hard can that be, you just walk up to the
          copier put the document in the feeder and hit start. So sure I will
          help clients if you get a line'. Then they watch me work for an hour
          during which I am running jobs on two copiers, printing posters, and
          binding a book all while faxing for the customer at my counter. My job
          at Office Depot greatly improved my ability to multitask. If I wasn't
          doing two things at once then it was a very slow day. In this
          position, I trained almost every employee in the store on how to take
          in orders, make and resize copies, laminate and fax for customers. So
          that they could back me up during peek hours. I was also in charge of
          making sure that supplies were in stock and ordered along with fixing
          broken machines or placing service calls on them. Over the years, I
          designed posters, flyers and business cards for several customers.

          Outside of work, I volunteered as the Hamfest chair for my local
          Amateur Radio Club. A Hamfest is a radio, computer and electronic
          hobby expo. In this position, I organized the club's annual Hamfest
          that typically attracted 40 vendors and 750 attendees from around the
          midwest. I handled communications between vendors and six
          subcommittees. One of the top complaints attendees and vendors had was
          that the club website was never up to date. The Hamfest committee also
          received several complaints from attendees they could not order
          tickets online and that we were stuck in the 90's with only accepting
          payment by mail or in person via cash or check.

          At the time no one in the club knew how to write code for a website
          and the previous webmaster had written the site in php. So in the fall
          of 2019, I was given access to the club website. This allowed me to
          try to keep the Hamfest page updated myself. Over the course of the
          next week, I taught myself to code in html and basic php and
          Javascript. By the end of the week, I found my new passion in life and
          had PayPal integrated into the site for attendees to place ticket
          orders online. When I lost my job and the pandemic hit a few months
          later. I took it as a sign to dive deeper in to my new found love of
          coding and web development.
